### Data interpretation notes

- The situation reports sometimes include cumulative cases and sometimes (appear to) report active cases.  I am trying to report cumulative cases, but I cannot guarantee the accuracy.

- Counts of cases and deaths are cumulative. A drop in cases means cases were ruled out or reclassified.

- The columns new_confirmed, new_probable, and new_suspect are also counted in the confirmed_cases, probable_cases and suspect_cases columns. In other words, do not sum them.

- 20180101: Cases reported here span from 1 Jan to 8 May. The temporal distribution of cases in that time period is not known. The cases reported during this period are apparently not included in subsequent situation reports.

- 20180513: Probable cases are now being reported. No information available on deaths or healthcare workers.

- 20180515: The distribution of deaths by health zone is uncertain - the situation report says 23 total, but not where. It's not clear why Ntondo health zone is reported with no cases.

- 20180523: The sitrep notes: "The investigations invalidated 8 of the 17 historical probable cases reported in Bikoro. As a reminder, these community deaths occurred in the weeks preceding the official notification that triggered the outbreak on May 8, 2018. As a result, these 8 cases were removed from the table." However, the 20180523 sitrep says "As a reminder, the figures given above relate exclusively to the active cases since the declaration of the epidemic on May 8, 2018 and do not include the 21 historical suspected cases reported before the declaration that were not the subject of laboratory analysis." It seems that the deaths were added on 20180517, but **it's not clear whether  surviving cases have also been added into case counts at some point.**
