### Data interpretation notes

- The situation reports sometimes include cumulative cases and sometimes (appear to) report active cases.  I am trying to report cumulative cases, but I cannot guarantee the accuracy.

- Counts of cases and deaths are cumulative. A drop in cases means cases were ruled out or reclassified.

- 20180101: Cases reported here span from 1 Jan to 8 May. The temporal distribution of cases in that time period is not known. The cases reported during this period are apparently not included in reports from May 11 and 12.

- 20180513: Probable cases are now being reported. No information available on deaths or healthcare workers.

- 20180515: The distribution of deaths by health zone is uncertain - the situation report says 23 total, but not where. It's not clear why Ntondo health zone is reported with no cases.
