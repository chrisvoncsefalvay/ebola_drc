### Data interpretation notes

- Cases and deaths should be added for a cumulative total. The reporting structure here reflects that of the situation reports.

- The situation reports do not currently include a 'probable' classification.

- Counts of cases and deaths are cumulative. A drop in cases means cases were ruled out or reclassified.

- 20180101: Cases reported here span from 1 Jan to 8 May. The temporal distribution of cases in that time period is not known.

- 20180514: Probable cases are now being reported. No information available on deaths or healthcare workers.
